			<p class='p1'>The Library is located in a complex of baroque-renaissance architecture, there, in 1773 the Bishop of Puebla, Francisco Fabian y Fuero, established the main nave: an orthogonal space with five vaults, illuminated by ten windows and their five balconies.

			<p class='p1'>In the XVI and XVII centuries libraries experienced major changes. In Europe the first public libraries appeared, such as the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the one established by Augustinians in Rome and the Escorial in Madrid, which imposed a new model of order and query for the books, for example, the texts were placed in cupboards with railings and attached to the wall, unlike the Middle Ages, just to mention one case, where the books were stored in cabinets.</p>

			<p class='quote'><b>Juan de Palafox y Mendoza (1600 - 1659)
Of the special benefits that God gave to this sinner in his childhood, 
before birth and then after he was born</b><br />
Palafox y Mendoza, Juan de. The spiritual life of his Excellency, the Illustrious and Venerable Don Juan de Palafox y Mendoza. Seville: Don Miguel de Vergara, 1691</p>
			<p class='p1'>Juan de Palafox y Mendoza was born in Fitero, Navarre, on 24 June 1600. He was the son of the Marquis of Ariza Don Jaime de Palafox y Rebolledo, and Dona Ana Casanate. After being rejected by his mother, he was raised by Pedro Navarro and it was not until he was nine years old that he was recognized by his aristocratic father. His mother repented and provided for his livelihood. She was later admitted to the order of the Barefoot Carmelites, where she remained until her death. </p>
				<p class='p2'>Palafox lived his youth at court, surrounded by books and knowledge. He studied at the Universities of Huesca, Alcala and Salamanca. In 1629 he was ordained a priest. He traveled to several countries in Europe serving as chaplain of the sister of King Felipe IV. The confidence the crown had in him is what sent him to New Spain at the age of 40 to serve in various positions. He was Bishop of Puebla between 1640 and 1649, and Viceroy of New Spain in 1642. He was interested in education, defended justice and good government. He believed in books as an essential tool for priests and also for the development of the people. He was particularly interested in politics, and collaborated in the drafting of the Laws of the Indies. In the education of seminarians he included the learning of indigenous languages and actively participated in the education of indigenous people.</p>
			<p class='p1'>In Puebla he had temples, shrines, altars, schools, hospitals, and Episcopal residences built, in addition to the cathedral that he personally consecrated. However, during his life, according to Palafox himself, he was accused of alleged flaws, payments of tithes and of seeking to reduce the influence of certain religious orders such as the Jesuits.</p>
			<p class='p2'>The Bishop wanted to die in Puebla, however, he died on October 1, 1659 in the city of Osma, Spain. His cenotaph, a funerary monument erected in his memory, is located in the Cathedral of Puebla.  Today, his mortal remains lie in the cenotaph, after being brought to Puebla on June 22, 2011, the year of his beatification.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='textonoche_5' class='parrafo noche'>
			<p class='p2'>With a passion akin to that of Palafox, in 1771, the Bishop of Puebla, Francisco Fabian y Fuero, also donated his personal library to increase the archives of the Palafoxiana. Additionally, Don Francisco played an important part in having a large number of volumes in the Jesuit libraries become part of the collection.</p>
			<p class='p1'>Don Francisco Fabian y Fuero was born in Terzaga, Spain, in 1719. He studied philosophy with the Carmelites of Calatayud and theology in Alcalá de Henares. He obtained a bachelor's degree in 1743 and a doctorate in 1744. In the year 1765, King Carlos III, granted him the title of Bishop of the city of Puebla de Los Angeles, a position he held until 1773. During this period, Fabian y Fuero ordered that the Library be decorated to achieve its transformation into a true work of art. During his tenure the first two levels of cedar bookshelves were built, with a capacity for 20,000 volumes, proving to be an exemplary work of cabinetmaking.</p>
			<p class='p2'>Francisco Fabian y Fuero was a tenacious individual, an excellent speaker, a reformer and a passionate advocate of the monarchy, ecclesiastical and Episcopal law; he died in Torrehermosa, Spain, in 1801, at the age of 81.</p>

			<p class='p1'><b class='capital'>T</b>he Biblia Regia or Polyglot Bible of Antwerp is an eight volume edition containing the text of the Scriptures in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and Latin. It was edited by Benito Arias Montano, and printed in Antwerp between 1569 and 1573. The Biblioteca Palafoxiana houses the complete collection of this important text.</p>
			<p class='p2'>As in all libraries of seminarian character, in addition to the volumes of scholastic and moral theology, sacred history, canon law, Liturgy, Fathers and Doctors of the church, Bibles are the central part and of the greatest importance in the archives.</p>
			<p class='p1'>Also housed here are books that have changed the course of humanity due to the knowledge they contain, for example: dictionaries, classic books on science, geography, ancient literature, grammar books and even titles considered profane. Also, here you can find incunabula, a name given to the books printed since the birth of the printing press up until the year 1500.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='textonoche_6' class='parrafo noche' style='position:relative'>
			<p class='p2'>A book houses more information than what is printed in it. To discover it, it is necessary to hold the book in your hands, feel it, observe it, and become familiar with it, for example, the texture and the shape of the binding. Ancient books are distinguished by being handmade. Each sheet was sewn with thread to the spine in the center fold and these threads were fixed to the cover.</p>
			<p class='p1'>Books were usually covered with leather and cardboard or vellum, which is a type of parchment made from a thin layer of treated leather which was used in the middle Ages.</p>
			<p class='p2'>The first books were written by hand. When printing appeared, movable type and typography were used, depending on each producer and his publishing house. The use of capital letters is notable in ancient books, as they are proportionally much larger than the other words, and they are used for the first word of each chapter or paragraph. Some are ornamented and possess images within them to facilitate the location of a certain passage. Between the invention of the printing press and the year 1500, the printing of the books called incunabula began.</p>
			<p class='p1'>In accordance with western tradition, the structure of ancient books consisted of the cover, where the most comprehensive information on the work can be found: author, title, engravers, edition, printer; and the text, the important part of the book, which can be divided into volumes, chapters, etc. Depending on the year, edition and content type, books may also have a cover page, colophon, index, frontispiece and elements of iconography, key elements of its identification.</p>
			<p class='p2'>Books contain other life marks that provide information about the people who owned them. One of them is a fire mark that was placed mainly on the edges by means of hot irons, bearing a figure, shield or name. There are also the proprietary marks, called ex libris, which could be any image representative of the personality of the owner and his name, in addition to some motto in Latin.</p>

			<p class='p1'><b class='capital'>T</b>he Palafoxiana appears small compared to the universe of knowledge it holds. We must consider that a library is much more than the building and the books found there. In order for it to work properly great organization is necessary. The Palafoxiana Library has been well-regulated since its foundation in the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth century regulations were written, of which one of the clauses reads:</p>
			<p class='texto_esp'>XVIII
It will be very important and we order that the librarians take care of picking up the papers, sermons, and other items, which are often printed in the Kingdom; because it has been observed that after a while nothing can be found and all these things occur in a country that does not yet known its full story, and learning the full story is something which some of these works can lead to. Therefore everything will be put away in the cupboards, or drawers, and the librarians will make sure that when enough papers form a competent body, that they be bound and that any other handwritten documents, or documents written in the symbols of the Indians, be stored as may be the case.</p>
			<p class='quote'><b>Ordinances for the use of the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, 1763</b><br/>
Fabian y Fuero, Francisco. Ordinances for the use of the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, in: Artes de Mexico: Artes de Mexico magazine, 2003</p>
			<p class='p1'>In his first few days in office Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza established that the care of the books would be the responsibility of the designated librarian or the rector of the colleges of Trent. Later, Bishop Fabian y Fuero, concerned about the permanence and preservation of the library, wrote a set of rigid regulations.
These regulations established timetables for housekeeping, queries, and so on.</p>
			<p class='p2'>Although it was public and open, at that time, and even today, external borrowing is unthinkable. The penalty, for anyone who extracted a book, was immediate excommunication, dictated by the Pope.</p>
			<p class='p1'>In the end, those standards were wise, because the library has remained almost intact until our days, after so many years, consultation is still permitted and it can also be visited.</p>
			<p class='p2'>It should be noted that since its inception, the library has continued to receive donations and has accumulated more volumes. In 1772, in addition to other special collections, it received the books from the libraries of the Jesuit colleges in Puebla, after they were expelled from Mexico in 1767 by order of King Charles the III.</p>
			<p class='p1'>Almost a century later, the library was part of the nationalization of church property along with the Tridentine seminars. In 1861 it passed into the hands of the government as a product of Reform legislation.</p>
			<p class='p2'>In 1862, after the reforms made by President Juárez, the Palafoxiana opened its doors as a Public State Library, preserving its entire structure.</p>
			<p class='p1'>The Library has survived the ravages of nature and men. Over the centuries it has withstood earthquakes and various military movements such as the French intervention in 1862 and the Mexican Revolution in 1910. This is why its permanence to today is considered without a doubt a posthumous achievement of Palafox´s.</p>
			<p class='p2'>In 1974 the Casa de la Cultura or House of Culture was inaugurated in the city of Puebla, which generated a cleaning and restoration process of the Library. In 1981, the library closed its doors to public consultation after being declared "National Historical Heritage". In 2005, after a long period of restoration, rescue and cataloging the Biblioteca Palafoxiana was registered in UNESCO's "Memory of the World" program as the first public library on the American continent.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='textonoche_7' class='parrafo noche'>
			<p class='p2'>One of the essential characteristics of a library is to preserve the information that is safeguarded within it for its dissemination. In the case of ancient books, it is not only important information, but the object itself becomes a record of the evolution of historical editorial techniques and their safeguarding process.</p>
			<p class='p1'>The main factors that put the preservation of the heritage of a library at risk are the environment, physical use, a lack of prevention and protection against disasters in addition to security against theft, as well as vandalism.</p>
			<p class='p2'>Currently, to prevent the destruction and loss of these valuable books, the library is fitted with glass with UV protection, and each week it is inspected by specialists for cleaning and a diagnosis of the heritage. There are also regular disinfection periods for the materials, as the archive materials are mostly of organic origin, and because of this they are subject to aging due to environmental factors.</p>

			<p class='p1'>Palafox y Mendoza brought ideas about a modern civilization from Europe. Therefore, he emphasized the importance of public library as a means of acquiring culture. As additional data, in 1627 famous librarian Gabriel Naudé published the treatise about library organization, where he promotes that it must "be devoted to public use, and communication should never be denied to the simplest of men who might require it", Palafox seemed to meticulously follow this advice.</p>
